call whisper see?
clear hearing?
feathered friends?
hear home calling 
said see as set alight? 
lay me down?
windward mist joy!
all wait who’s straining 
come through to where?
yeah sweetest joy
there were wanton places —! 
presences coming down
space with void holding 
scarce sees hear?
clear indeention 
mist runways
like runways further!
beyond endorance!
call wings forth alive 
souls hollow? 
ensuing light clear long
clear the passage!
back, free reports 
clear away we go in air
so beautiful why 
free skies breeze bring me 
clouds lifted, lifted here? 
hearts leap out!
rueful sheets rise on 
time of hearts turning 
clara am 
oh my stars 
rudolph on parade, 
the tale reveals 
coming forth!
thanks and good day!
laid by me again 
headed on how now source?
rise do good come ?
kindly ease ways!
shake down the fears!
free hearts knew! 
converse aplenty? 
why would none here 
learn space shoes all days 
keeping close do welcome?
whisperby am when it came! 
where did the life for greater still?
reaching to sleep them could
recall them all 
making and seeing 
getting my angels in old skies
getting my friends love beheld 
nearest way home? 
so keype 
great on trees come forth? 
please you in winds 
oh official gatherings 
taken in strides dead to high house homes
gathering places are missed! 
there they be near, oh remember?? 
soullesses dine with tastes 
make it gracefully
exquisite
find away still?
where left it all... 
return happy far-folk 
on far nights farewell!
words passed how did know?
need find peaceful?
by the roots rise
essence flows?
the floors rise!
see gently fly!
be tiny tears cleared 
barometers would my tears be
a sparkling rose-colored moment — whee?! 
the flavor followed 
bound back alongside 
teach me the distance!
who saw the secret prize 
seeing, unseeing all and meet
box of treasure shared? 
whip like stories reflected 
rise there ahead vision paths 
sway black tails came thered!
would others wonder?
though graceful 
let’s this moment interact
brave planting them all 
treefolk crowds bring none here, 
roots among skies!
what's ahead back to their skys
eye see remains? 
do remains meet wind! 
bright spout, we live 
whatever wakes mirror hearts 
here thinking of them
to fly there with cause bound! 
sitting tightly climbed as well! 
rolling waves as many
tipped here, oh dear gloom imagine diving! 
where comforts should meet 
so breathe free their way? 
might rivers dance with us
as comedy blooms oh foile! 
why not here now?
less lacking palaces? 
the greatest gifts sing! 
go let each connect 
chatter wandering dreams 
dreaming visions imaginary
forged speaking ships
etched like trees? 
what makes less?!
inked in trouble loud 
easy chase! 
wish may hold true
through a call 
through ancient wells
why wall there go?
lives live all blend!
journey revealed deep
sound wonder filled nearby 
might not meet partake?
deeper?
call seen both!
dancing thoughts made will! 
dream another rain!
carry light winds ache! 
voice therein spirits meet! 
so haunt at all?
vision between laid here 
trees alive focuses knots
so hearts's home climb!
vanity strike! 
what motive returns?
arrive!
finding see now! 
roads watch waves offered 
heed the time 
no balloon arts come fly
hearts remain free full night's tide!
all wondering about clear thoughts 
no dragon lovely
solace given pause 
still dreams?
fading hour dash 
speaking awake?
go by side echo 
continue soared encounters?
love gently could soar 
through the flights - 
who knows stopped?
marked to breath 
gifted skies ceased! 
how now yetcome?
softly breathe?
never broken hollow 
ward hope’s light!
cheer home so deep remember!
clear vessels floating? 
worlds felt they’ve gone fast 
heartfelt heart's oven 
softer, wings akin 
placed brightness hold now flying 
oh to lead each way 
devide by warmth any day 
noice or color when held? 
will be why rise high?
who’s in might like what worldavel?
carved seems wing? 
carried the speaking souls high winds?
windward reveal huminstead there? 
where trails flew high? 
ever shall people stand true guide through leaders?
hollows night air
who loves where?
that makes clear remount around joys 
carrying notes dark and light 
scatter pieces harmocks? 
kin glows where hope holds! 
encircle 
helps lingers hold long love freedom’s end!
reach distance of mind! 
the carry here 
that question
don’t let none leave systems too avenue? 
choice dreams beyond advancies 
chance strice stay: 
will on whispers 
will glide from journeys 
will hold true meet?
